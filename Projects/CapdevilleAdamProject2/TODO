Implement a disk simulator that allows for writing and 
reading information using logical linear addresses. 


The code in disk.zip archive provides: 
Declaration of the disk geometry
Prototypes of the functions (To be Implemented)


There is also some demonstration code and seed code for testing.
You must replace that with your own code to test your implementation.


There are details of the implementation in the comments accompanying the code.
